        'For the tamarind chutney:',
            '2 tsp vegetable oil',
            '½ tsp each cumin, cardamom, and ground ginger',

    instructions: [
      'To make the sauce chutney, place the oil and spices into a small saucepan and place over a low heat. Once the spices start sizzling, and smell slightly richer, add the remaining ingredients and bring the mixture to a boil. Boil for about 2 minutes, or until slightly thickened. Set aside to cool.',
      'To make the onion pakoras, peel and finely slice the onions into half moons. Place the onions into a mixing bowl and add the remaining ingredients. Slowly add ½ cup of water, mixing as you go, to get a batter the consistency of very thick greek yoghurt. When everything is mixed together, cover the bowl with a cloth and set aside for about 10 minutes or so - this helps the onion to soften slightly, and helps the fritters hold together more readily.',
      'Heat about 2 inches of oil in a deep saucepan. Place a piece of onion in the pan - when it floats to the surface and sizzles, the oil is ready to go (about 350F/170C).',
      'Place heaping tablespoons full of the onion mixture into the oil - try and get a good equal ratio of onion to batter - and leave them to cook for about 3 minutes, flipping halfway. They will turn a nice golden brown, and should be cooked all the way through. Cut a fritter in half to test if need be.',
      'When all the fritters are cooked, pile them on a platter and serve with the room temperature chutney.'
